## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

Everything works except for clicking on the palettes to return them to the main palette screen. I coulsn't get this to work because I could figure out how to have the palettes diplay without refreshing and be able to click on the palettes.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/benjaminhayek/palette-picker/commit/8b9cb7a63a9a0d391286d9c1e1c5293657d592f0)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I liked how i was able to get both the id's in order to delete the palette and thoush this was a ppretty good way of doing it.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/benjaminhayek/palette-picker/commit/0ab6f0095a85f863776280333f4298ca91eb8e20)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
I felt like there was probably a better way of locking projects and thought this was kin of sloppy. I felt like if i was to refactor it i would have to add quite a bit more code to do it diferently.

#### Link to Design Inspiration
[link to inspiration](https://dribbble.com/shots/1602107-Represent)
* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

I like how they used the rainbow gradient on the title which i used for both my header and button to generate a new palette
